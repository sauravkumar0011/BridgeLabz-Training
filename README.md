```
- Learned Java Generics for type-safe and reusable collection handling.
- Understood Type Parameters (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`) and their role in APIs.
- Implemented Generic Classes and Generic Methods.
- Used Bounded Types (`extends`, `super`) to restrict and control types.
- Applied Wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`) for flexible collections.
- Followed Generics best practices (no raw types, safe bounds, readable design)

### 🗓 Day 2 – Java Collections Framework (List, Set, Queue & Map)  
**(Date: 17-Jan-2026)**
- Studied Java Collections Framework architecture and hierarchy.
- Understood the role of `Collection` and `Map` interfaces.
- Learned **List Interface** and its implementations:
  - `ArrayList`
  - `LinkedList`
  - `Vector`
- Performed common List operations:
  - Add, remove, update, search
  - Iteration using for-each, Iterator, and ListIterator
- Learned **Set Interface** and its implementations:
  - `HashSet`
  - `LinkedHashSet`
  - `TreeSet`
- Understood uniqueness, ordering, and sorting behavior in Sets.
- Learned **Map Interface** and its implementations:
  - `HashMap`
  - `LinkedHashMap`
  - `TreeMap`
- Performed key-value operations:
  - Insertion, deletion, retrieval
  - Iteration using `entrySet()`, `keySet()`, and `values()`
-  Learned **Queue Interface** and its implementations:
  - `PriorityQueue`
  - `ArrayDeque`
- Studied queue operations:
  - Enqueue, dequeue, peek & poll
- Understood FIFO behavior and priority-based processing.
- Understood internal working, use cases, and performance considerations.
- Practiced real-time examples for List, Set, Queue and Map.
- Committed and pushed all work.

### 🗓 Day 3 – Java I/O Streams  
**(Date: 19-Jan-2026)**
- Studied Java I/O Streams architecture and stream-based data handling.
- Covered Byte Streams and Character Streams for file operations.
- Learned and implemented:
  - `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`
  - `FileReader`, `FileWriter`
  - `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`
  - `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`
- Understood Object Streams:
  - `ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`
  - Serialization and deserialization
- Practiced in-memory streams:
  - `ByteArrayInputStream`, `ByteArrayOutputStream`
- Used bridge streams:
  - `InputStreamReader`, `OutputStreamWriter`
- Applied try-with-resources, buffering, and performance best practices.
- Solved practical problems including file copy, serialization, and efficient large-file reading.
- Committed and pushed all work.
